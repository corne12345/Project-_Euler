# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the
# product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Multiplying two 3-digit numbers will result in an 5 or 6 digit number. The largest
# palindrome will probably contain 6 digits.

largest = 0
